# Score Savvy

Score Savvy is a test project aimed at creating a simple app to keep scores during a board game match. This project helped me enhance my skills with Dart and the Flutter framework. As the project evolved, I saw potential in it and decided to rewrite it using different technologies, such as switching from Riverpod to Bloc for state management and Isar to Hive for local saves.

While the full version of this app may eventually become a commercial product, I am excited to share Score Savvy as a portfolio piece that showcases some of my skills as a Flutter developer.
